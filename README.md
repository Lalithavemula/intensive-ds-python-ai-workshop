# Intensive Data Science Workshop using Python for AI

This repository houses two hands-on Data Science projects developed during an intensive workshop:

1. ## 🏙️ Area Safety Prediction  
   Predicts whether a geographical area is safe or not based on survey features such as:
   - Number of wine shops nearby  
   - Street lighting  
   - Proximity to police station  
   - Presence of graveyards  
   - Surveillance types & smuggling activities  
   - **Script:** `area_safety/area_safety.py`  
   - **Details:** See [area_safety/README.md](area_safety/README.md)

2. ## ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction  
   Uses the UCI Heart Disease dataset to classify patients as at-risk or not, featuring:
   - Exploratory data analysis & visualizations  
   - Random Forest classification  
   - Model evaluation (accuracy, report, confusion matrix)  
   - Feature importance & prescriptive insights  
   - **Script:** `heart_disease/heart.py`  
   - **Details:** See [heart_disease/README.md](heart_disease/README.md)
